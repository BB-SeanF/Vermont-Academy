        description: `<p>Welcome to Vermont Academy’s new Website! Based on our last conversation, along with all the notes I received initially, it was clear from the jump that everyone agreed that an update was long overdue. It was also clear that there were some different ideas on how these updates could be achieved. The following design is the result of taking all these notes along with VA’s existing branding elements and collateral to generate a sleek, and modern approach to the school’s front end site.</p> 
        
        <p>This is also a design where the static nature of the mockup presentation limits me a bit more than I’d like, forcing me to rely on these notes to explain in greater detail how some items and interactions will behave on the final site. Starting with our Homepage, on initial load visitors will see the large image before elements transition into view in the following order: “we are” “va”, the call to action buttons that appear below, and finally both the “scroll down” text and the site’s nav and logo region. If of course the visitor immediately goes to engage with the navigation, these element will become visible to them, regardless of order. The look and feel of this section borrows from VA’s viewbook, which is a design language that is leaned into throughout the whole design.</p> 
        
        <p>Scrolling down the page we’re greeted with the first section of the homepage, an introduction to the school that once again borrows heavily from the “we are” motif from the viewbook. As we arrive in this section, we see hinted below three image links that will allow the visitor to dive into the site into specific areas. This layout features academic, student life, and athletic links, but these very much don’t have to go to these sections all the time or at all. When hovered (shown on the next frame, additional text will appear to highlight and invite the user to click and explore deeper.</p>
        
        <p> Below this is a region that serves as an “At a Glance” type of section, though should feel unique and a bit more organic than just a list of facts. Included here is copy that outlines an at a glance view of VA, stats with iconography (or large numbers) that highlight key elements about the school, and a quote block that also serves as an insight into the school. All of these are laid out in an interesting looking “broken” grid.</p>

        <p> News and Events follows up this section, with the familiar “Happening around Campus” heading. Events here remain mostly unchanged outside of an aesthetic update, but we do find a new featured news carousel here. Having a single news area solves for a few elements, including keeping this area compact. It also allows you to curate news a little easier, having one feed on the homepage and allows the visitor to engage as they see fit. Through the site you’ll have the option to pepper additional stories as you see fit in an organic way (ie: Headmaster posts), so don’t fret that this is the only means a someone will have to digest news on the site.</p>

        <p>The homepage is rounded out with a final value add and call to action section with additional text that invites the visitor to take the next steps; applying, requesting more information or visiting the campus. Below this is of course the site’s footer. Here we see VA’s seal, address, boilerplate, footer links and social media. Simple and straightforward, as a footer should be.</p>`,
